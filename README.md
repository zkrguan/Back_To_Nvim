# Back_To_Nvim
It could be helpful if you have some Vim experience before. Heard Nvim is getting hot. And wanna try it out. 
Honestly, those motion key combos makes you feel like playing street fighters while coding. 

Bad part is I am so used to press ESC while finish editing something. 

While writing some descriptions on PR, while editing a sent message on discord, GG!

# The Vim I know was like this.

# If you are a rookie like me from 2023/08 who only use vim to change files on the deployment server directly.
Try the kickstart-nvim. So nice. Literally so easy. 
```
1. 
https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.

If you don't have a .config repo inside your home.
2. mkdir -p ~/.config/vim

3. cd ~/.config/vim

4. nvim init.lua

5. copy and paste whatever inside the kick start vim init.lua

6. start your nvim, and all the plugins will be installed

7. nvim inside your working repo

8. space + sf and this is like a magic

```
Looks better than you thought right? Pretty fun to use with.

# NVim after I customized.
Still Trying out. You will find my most current vim.init file in this repo. 

# Commands for the tools I tried.
