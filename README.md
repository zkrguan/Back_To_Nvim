# Back_To_Nvim
It could be helpful if you have some Vim experience before. Heard Nvim is getting hot. And wanna try it out. 
Honestly, those motion key combos makes you feel like playing street fighters while coding. 

Bad part is I am so used to press ESC while finish editing something. 

While writing some descriptions on PR, while editing a sent message on discord, GG!

# NVim after I customized.
Still Trying out. You will find my most current vim.init file in this repo. 

# Commands for the tools I tried.
